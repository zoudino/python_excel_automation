# python_excel_automation
This project used python, openpyxl, and excel to automation the process of inserting data into the excel sheet which reducing a large amount of time to manually doing those work
I want to write a summary of how to use the scripts in here. So, we can go through the process smoothly tomorrow. As you recommended, the user has to create the following folders and paths:
C:\reports 
C:\reports\inputs ( all the raw excel file will be stored in here)
C:\reports\outputs
C:\reports\img \( the image 'test_2.png' will be stored in the img folder)

After all those things are ready. Then, the user needs to run the report.exe. Once the program is finished. The user could see the result in outputs. I also attached two files to this email. One is 'test2.png'. Another is 'report.exe'.
